🔥 Best Placement Options for Skills
1️⃣ Inside "My Journey" (Best for Career Focus)
Since "My Journey" already includes Experience + Education, you can add a "Skills" subsection.

🎓 Education
💼 Experience
🛠️ Skills (Programming, Tools, Frameworks)
✅ Best if you want Skills to be part of your career journey.


2️⃣ Inside "Portfolio" (Best if Skills Relate to Projects)
If your skills are strongly tied to your projects, list them inside "Portfolio" before showing your projects.
